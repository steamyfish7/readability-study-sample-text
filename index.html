    <p><strong>TRIAL 1: 6 pt</strong></p>
    <p style="font-size: 6pt;">
        The North Wind and the Sun were disputing which was the stronger, when a traveller came along the road. 
        "Let us agree," said the Sun, "that he is the stronger who can make that traveller take off his coat." 
        So the North Wind blew as hard as it could, and the man wrapped his coat more closely around him; 
        but the Sun shone out warm and bright, and immediately the man took off his coat.
